# Order Bulk Manager

Speed up order processing with our app that adds new mass actions for invoicing and shipment. Push multiple orders to
the queue at once and let automated background processing handle the rest — saving time, reducing errors, and keeping
your operations smooth.

## Installation

Follow instructions in the [installation guide](INSTALL.md).

## Key Features

After installation and turning on the app in Admin UI SDK (`System > Configuration > Adobe Services > Admin UI SDK`)
you will see new mass actions for order grid (`Sales > Orders`); for mass invoicing and shipment.

Select orders you want to process (up to 10K at once) and just push the action for sending them to the queue.

Chill out and monitor the progress by `Sales > Order Action Queue`, let the app do the rest.
